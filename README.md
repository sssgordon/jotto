## What this project is about

This jotto game is my attempt on test-driven development (TDD) using Jest and Enzyme on React and Redux. The app is modelled after Bonnie Schulkin's [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme/) on Udemy.

Jotto is a word game where the player attempts to guess the 5-letter *secret word* :key: After every attempt, the app will tell the player the amount of letters in the guessed word matching the *secret word*. For example, if the *secret word* is "party" and the guessed word is "train", the app will tell you that 3 letters are matching ("a", "r", "t").
